                    I'm Gautham - scientist, developer and dreamer. I'm currently studying Computer Science, but my
                    journey
                    through
                    Honors and UW has taken me through various classes and disciplines. This is a portfolio of some of
                    my
                    experiences
                    throughout college.

                <h1>Learning Statement</h1>
                <p>
                    The quote above has driven me throughout college, as I hope it will in my future. When I entered
                    UW, I was completely sure about my plans and dreams. However, after participating in the
                    COPE health scholars program, I realized that the career path I had previously chosen
                    was not fit for me. After my first
                    year of college, I found myself in the position of being completely unsure about what I wanted
                    to do, as well as how to do it. However, I let the quote guide me, as I swallowed my anxiety
                    and forged my path forward. Later, during my major, I again had anxiety over taking the most
                    difficult
                    classes. However, my motivation allowed me to discover my aspirations within computer science and
                    begin my
                    plan for the future.
                <p>The COPE program was truly a transformative experience. Although I was very interested in
                    working in
                    a hospital and excited about patient care, I rapidly burned out. I began to doubt myself,
                    wondering
                    if the
                    track I had chosen was right for me after all. At the same time, I was in Honors classes with
                    students
                    from all backgrounds and fields of study – from English to political science to informatics.
                    Even
                    though
                    my classes seemed somewhat normal – history, linguistics, etc. – the exposure to these variety
                    of
                    viewpoints allowed me to reconsider my convictions. I wanted to make a difference and help
                    people,
                    but there was no one way to do so. </p>
                <p>At the same time, I began to find another of my passions – one for understanding the building
                    blocks
                    of
                    things, and how they worked. This passion had always driven me through my biology and chemistry
                    classes, and I was able to apply it to my new major, computer science. These diverse interests truly
                    culminated
                    in
                    my research at the Brunton Lab, where I was able to unite my passions for medicine and computer
                    science. </p>
                <p> Within the computer science major, I found myself somewhat of a generalist, without any particular
                    inclinations. I found myself attracted to the "hip" new topics of data science and machine learning,
                    but found them to be unfulfilling. I was continuously nagged by my desire to work with the building
                    blocks of my field -- in this case, low level systems programming. When a friend convinced me to
                    try a class, my decision to hold learning over fear kicked in, and I discovered an interest
                    in systems programming that I continue to explore.
                </p>
                <p>My intended audience for the portfolio is anybody who is unsure about their convictions or wants
                    to
                    learn about how, in an age of increasing specialization, interdisciplinary knowledge is still
                    incredibly
                    useful. I intend to use this portfolio for myself in a similar manner – reminding myself as I go
                    on
                    to not
                    be narrow-minded and stick to a single specialization or area of expertise, and rather to keep
                    my
                    horizons broad and learn new things always.
                    I invite the reader to reflect back on my journey with me, as we work to learn these lessons
                    together.
