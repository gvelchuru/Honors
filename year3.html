                            taking an Honors class.
                            While I anticipated this would be very similar to my introductory Biology coursework, I
                            found this class
                            to be an excellent building block: it described broader trends and applications in biology,
                            which inspired me
                            to continue working in that field.

                            Although it was incredibly challenging and time-consuming (implementing Paxos took at least
                            100 hours),
                            it was absolutely worth it. I gained an appreciation of the workings of large-scale computer
                            systems, and
                            discovered my future path in computer science.

                            to put my CS skills into practice. Working with a real distributed system was a challenge,
                            but it was worth it for the feeling of contributing to a real product improving people's
                            lives every single day. With the help of my mentors, I was successfully able to lower
                            the system upgrade time by about 80%.
