                            doing
                            tasks such as taking vitals, feeding and bathing patients, etc. The program has the ability
                            to
                            explore multiple departments and gain a variety of experiences, such as witnessing babies
                            being

                            and simply cannot handle all the requests of patients - my ability to help with basic

                            My broader career goal is to go to medical school and become a doctor. However, this path is
                            quite long and challenging, albeit potentially incredibly rewarding. As such, it is very
                            important for me to receive a preview of the inner workings of a hospital, what the patient
                            care
                            experience is like, etc. This program is like very few others in that it allows me to stay

                            the floor as a part of the patient care team along with the nurses, doctors, etc. This
                            program
                            helps me have close contact with the patients and in many cases provides me with emotional
                            connection and a deeper understanding of the patient experience which is essential to the
                            empathetic aspect of medicine</h3>

                            Many of the patients in the hospital are in long-term care, and along with their medicinal
                            care,
                            they require emotional care - a friendly face to talk to them or help them walk around.
                            Although
                            the nurses do all they can, they unfortunately face the issue of being overbooked and cannot
                            devote a great deal of individual care to each patient. My role of providing this care
                            improves
                            the patient experience at Swedish, in line with the Swedish mission of patient-centered
                            care.

                            performing original research. All of my observations in the lab were completely original and
                            built on and complemented existing research, rather than simply repeating it.

                            the bleeding edge of a field. I specifically selected this engagement due to the opportunity

                            My intended major is neurobiology. In order to extend my in-class learning about this field,
                            I
                            hoped
                            to do neurobiology research with a focus on Caenorhabditis elegans, a model organism for the
                            nervous
                            system which was the first organism to have its entire neural network sequenced.
                            Additionally,
                            research is important for a future in medical school – medical schools value individual
                            research
                            as
                            it demonstrates individual creative and analytical thinking as well as dedication to the
                            sciences.

                            ​My research contributed to several larger goals. In a general sense, performing research
                            contributes towards the knowledge of the scientific community, and by extension, humanity as
                            a
                            whole. In a more specific sense, performing research contributes to the goals of my lab by
                            participating in trials which are going to be featured on scientific papers – this allows
                            the
                            lab to publish more papers, receive more grants, etc.
