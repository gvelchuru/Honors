                        The COPE Health Scholar opportunity involves the ability to volunteer as a basic healthcare
                        provider in Swedish at First Hill. The program involves volunteering for 4 hours a week, doing
                        tasks such as taking vitals, feeding and bathing patients, etc. The program has the ability to
                        explore multiple departments and gain a variety of experiences, such as witnessing babies being
                        born in the delivery room or observe surgeries in an operating room.
                    </h3>
                    <h3>
                        This activity demonstrates the values of service because it involves dedicating my time and
                        energy to help the community. In Swedish, it is often the case that the nurses are overbooked
                        and simply cannot handle all the requests of patients - my ability to help with basic patient
                        care allows me to perform service for both patients and nurses alike.

                        My broader career goal is to go to medical school and become a doctor. However, this path is
                        quite long and challenging, albeit potentially incredibly rewarding. As such, it is very
                        important for me to receive a preview of the inner workings of a hospital, what the patient care
                        experience is like, etc. This program is like very few others in that it allows me to stay on
                        the floor as a part of the patient care team along with the nurses, doctors, etc. This program
                        helps me have close contact with the patients and in many cases provides me with emotional
                        connection and a deeper understanding of the patient experience which is essential to the
                        empathetic aspect of medicine</h3>
                    <h3>.
                        ​
                        Many of the patients in the hospital are in long-term care, and along with their medicinal care,
                        they require emotional care - a friendly face to talk to them or help them walk around. Although
                        the nurses do all they can, they unfortunately face the issue of being overbooked and cannot
                        devote a great deal of individual care to each patient. My role of providing this care improves
                        the patient experience at Swedish, in line with the Swedish mission of patient-centered care.
