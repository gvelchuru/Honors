                            experience.
                            It began with the assignment "Who are you?". In this assignment, I considered many aspects
                            of my UW career
                            such as the path that had led me to the UW as well as my plan of study.

                            The COPE Health Scholar opportunity involves the ability to volunteer as a basic healthcare
                            provider in Swedish at First Hill. The program involves volunteering for 4 hours a week,
                            doing
                            tasks such as taking vitals, feeding and bathing patients, etc. The program has the ability
                            to
                            explore multiple departments and gain a variety of experiences, such as witnessing babies
                            being
                            born in the delivery room or observe surgeries in an operating room.

                            This activity demonstrates the values of service because it involves dedicating my time and
                            energy to help the community. In Swedish, it is often the case that the nurses are
                            overbooked
                            and simply cannot handle all the requests of patients - my ability to help with basic
                            patient
                            care allows me to perform service for both patients and nurses alike.

                            My activity involved individual research in the Ailion Lab in the Biochemistry department.
                            My
                            research had consisted of working closely with my faculty mentor, studying the fitness of
                            different strains of Caenorhabditis elegans in various temperatures. This activity involved
                            performing original research. All of my observations in the lab were completely original and
                            built on and complemented existing research, rather than simply repeating it.

                            For over a year prior to this research experience, I had been engaged in research in

                            labs. Research as an activity is quite interesting to me, as it offers the opportunity to be
                            on
                            the bleeding edge of a field. I specifically selected this engagement due to the opportunity
                            to
                            gain experience in a lab and to get an hands-on understanding of biology and neurobiology
                            beyond
                            what is taught in the classroom.
