                            doing
                            tasks such as taking vitals, feeding and bathing patients, etc. The program has the ability
                            to
                            explore multiple departments and gain a variety of experiences, such as witnessing babies

                            My broader career goal is to go to medical school and become a doctor. However, this path is
                            quite long and challenging, albeit potentially incredibly rewarding. As such, it is very
                            important for me to receive a preview of the inner workings of a hospital, what the patient
                            care

                            connection and a deeper understanding of the patient experience which is essential to the

                            Many of the patients in the hospital are in long-term care, and along with their medicinal
                            care,
                            they require emotional care - a friendly face to talk to them or help them walk around.
                            Although
                            the nurses do all they can, they unfortunately face the issue of being overbooked and cannot
                            devote a great deal of individual care to each patient. My role of providing this care
                            improves
                            the patient experience at Swedish, in line with the Swedish mission of patient-centered
                            care.

                        <h3>
                            My activity involved individual research in the Ailion Lab in the Biochemistry department.
                            My
                            research had consisted of working closely with my faculty mentor, studying the fitness of
                            different strains of Caenorhabditis elegans in various temperatures. This activity involved
                            performing original research. All of my observations in the lab were completely original and
                            built on and complemented existing research, rather than simply repeating it.

                        <h3>
                            For over a year prior to this research experience, I had been engaged in research in
                            different
                            labs. Research as an activity is quite interesting to me, as it offers the opportunity to be
                            on
                            the bleeding edge of a field. I specifically selected this engagement due to the opportunity
                            to
                            gain experience in a lab and to get an hands-on understanding of biology and neurobiology
                            beyond
                            what is taught in the classroom.

                            My intended major is neurobiology. In order to extend my in-class learning about this field,
                            I
                            hoped
                            to do neurobiology research with a focus on Caenorhabditis elegans, a model organism for the
                            nervous
                            system which was the first organism to have its entire neural network sequenced.
                            Additionally,
                            research is important for a future in medical school â€“ medical schools value individual
                            research
                            as
                            it demonstrates individual creative and analytical thinking as well as dedication to the
                            sciences.

                            â€‹My research contributed to several larger goals. In a general sense, performing research
                            contributes towards the knowledge of the scientific community, and by extension, humanity as
                            a
                            whole. In a more specific sense, performing research contributes to the goals of my lab by
                            participating in trials which are going to be featured on scientific papers â€“ this allows
                            the
                            lab to publish more papers, receive more grants, etc.
