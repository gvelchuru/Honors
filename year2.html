                            I was able to further study Spanish which I had already taken some classes of in high
                            school, and I wrote <a href="https://1drv.ms/b/s!Ai4AkhEEhtq6haIUjMiWONu1EdNgFw"> this
                                paper </a> which won an award from the Slavic Languages and Literatures

                        <h2>I had decided to try something new, namely computer science. Due to time constraints,
                            I had to join CSE 143X, the combined version of 142/143. It was extremely daunting, both due
                            to the
                            pace of the material as well as the huge amount of knowledge everyone else in the class
                            already had.
                            However, it turned out to be a truly rewarding experience, and I emerged with a brand new
                            understanding
                            and appreciation of the fundamentals of programming and computer science as a whole.

                            with
                            applied computer science as a whole. My project involved using facial recognition and
                            machine learning
                            techniques to automatically determine facial pose, and then correlate it with emotion.
                            It was a fantastic opportunity to apply my skills
                            from my intro CSE classes as well as learn more about neurobiology and machine
